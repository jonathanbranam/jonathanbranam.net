Tangible Analytics is the data science consultancy of Jonathan Branam. I
specialize in data analytics & visualization, machine learning, big data, and
artificial intelligence. If you have data and need to learn actionable insights
from it, I can help!

I favor using R for exploratory data analysis and visualization. Depending on
the data and the need, R or Python might good choices for machine learning and
processing the data further.
